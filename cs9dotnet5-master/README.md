## C# 9 and .NET 5 - Modern Cross-Platform Development, Fifth Edition

> .NET 5 reached its end-of-life on [Tuesday, May 10, 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/may-2022-updates/). I recommend upgrading to [.NET 6](https://github.com/markjprice/cs10dotnet6/blob/main/README.md) or [.NET 7](https://github.com/markjprice/cs11dotnet7/blob/main/README.md).

## Important
Corrections for typos and other mistakes, and improvements like refactoring code.
